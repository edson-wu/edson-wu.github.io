I am a PhD candidate in Economics at The University of Texas at Austin. 

**I will be on the job market during the 2024-2025 academic year.** 
<div style="text-align: justify;">
My research agenda centers on macroeconomics and monetary economics, with a particular focus on how expectations formation by
different agents shapes the transmission of economic shocks to the aggregate economy.
